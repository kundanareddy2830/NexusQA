MASTER UI GENERATION PROMPT
Product: NexusQA – Autonomous DevSecOps QA Intelligence Engine
________________


PROMPT START
Design a professional, enterprise-grade web application UI for a product called:
NexusQA – Autonomous AI-Powered Bug & Hygiene Discovery Engine
The UI should look like a hybrid of:
* Cybersecurity command center

* AI observability dashboard

* DevSecOps intelligence platform

* Graph analytics system

It must feel powerful, minimal, intelligent, and futuristic — not cluttered.
Use a dark theme with electric blue, teal, neon green, and subtle red/orange for critical alerts.
The UI must look like it is used by CTOs, DevOps teams, and Security Engineers.
