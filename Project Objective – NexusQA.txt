Project Objective – NexusQA
What We Are Building
We are building NexusQA, an autonomous AI-powered Bug & Hygiene Discovery Engine.
Its purpose is to automatically explore, analyze, and evaluate any web application — without requiring predefined test scripts — and generate a structured understanding of its quality, risks, and defects.
Unlike traditional QA tools that depend on manual scripting, NexusQA independently:
* Crawls and maps application structure

* Understands page types and navigation flows

* Detects functional, UI, performance, accessibility, and security issues

* Classifies and prioritizes defects

* Generates a structured defect knowledge graph

* Calculates a hygiene score representing overall application quality

* Produces reproducible test scripts for detected issues

In short, we are building a self-driven QA intelligence engine.

🎯 What the System Actually Does
NexusQA performs five core functions:
________________


1️⃣ Autonomous Discovery
The system starts with a single URL.


It:
   * Explores the entire application

   * Handles Single Page Applications (SPAs)

   * Interacts with buttons, forms, search fields

   * Handles authentication (OAuth2, SSO, token-based systems)

   * Identifies page types (dashboard, form, list, wizard, report, etc.)

   * Maps the navigation flow between states

It builds a complete structural map of the application.
________________


2️⃣ Intelligent Bug Detection
During and after exploration, NexusQA:
      * Monitors DOM structure

      * Tracks console errors

      * Analyzes network requests

      * Observes browser telemetry

      * Identifies broken flows

      * Detects missing validations

      * Detects UI inconsistencies

      * Identifies performance bottlenecks

      * Checks accessibility violations

      * Detects hygiene issues (SEO gaps, layout issues, structural problems)

It does not just execute tests — it analyzes behavior.
________________


3️⃣ Defect Knowledge Graph Generation
Instead of producing flat reports, the system creates a structured graph linking:
Page → Element → Issue Type → Severity → Reproducibility
This creates:
         * Clear traceability

         * Context-aware defect classification

         * Impact-based prioritization

         * Root-cause correlation across flows

This structured intelligence enables deeper quality insights.
________________


4️⃣ Hygiene Scoring & Risk Assessment
For every page and for the entire application, NexusQA:
            * Calculates defect density

            * Evaluates issue severity distribution

            * Classifies risk levels

            * Generates an overall Hygiene Score

The hygiene score provides a measurable quality index representing:
               * Functional stability

               * UI consistency

               * Accessibility compliance

               * Performance health

               * Structural cleanliness

This turns qualitative QA findings into quantitative intelligence.
________________


5️⃣ Reproducible AI-Driven Test Cycles
For critical issues, NexusQA:
                  * Reconstructs the exact path used to find the defect

                  * Generates a reproducible Playwright script

                  * Enables developers to replay and validate issues instantly

This bridges the gap between detection and resolution.

❓ Why This Is Needed
Modern web applications are:
                     * Highly dynamic (SPAs, microservices)

                     * Rapidly deployed (CI/CD)

                     * Increasingly complex

                     * Difficult to manually test thoroughly

Traditional QA approaches:
                        * Require manual scripting

                        * Struggle with modern frontend routing

                        * Produce fragmented reports

                        * Lack intelligent prioritization

                        * Do not autonomously adapt to new flows

As applications scale, manual testing and static automation cannot keep up.
Enterprises need:
                           * Autonomous discovery

                           * Intelligent classification

                           * Structured defect mapping

                           * Scalable performance validation

                           * Quantified quality metrics

                           * Fast reproducibility

NexusQA addresses this gap by acting as an AI-driven quality inspector that continuously explores, analyzes, and evaluates applications independently.

🏗 The Core Mission
To build a unified AI engine that:
                              * Crawls any web application

                              * Understands its structure

                              * Detects defects across multiple dimensions

                              * Classifies and scores hygiene

                              * Visualizes risk clearly

                              * Enables faster resolution

Essentially:
NexusQA functions as a self-driven QA inspector that converts complex application behavior into structured, actionable quality intelligence.

🧩 In One Sentence
NexusQA is an autonomous AI system that explores web applications like a human tester, analyzes them like a security auditor, scores them like a quality engineer, and documents them like a structured intelligence platform.
