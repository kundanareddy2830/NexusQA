MASTER UI DESIGN PROMPT
Product: NexusQA – Autonomous DevSecOps QA Intelligence Engine
________________


🎯 PRODUCT EXPERIENCE GOAL
Design a professional, enterprise-grade web application UI for:
NexusQA – Autonomous AI-Powered Bug & Hygiene Discovery Engine
The interface must feel like:
* A cybersecurity command center

* An AI observability system

* A DevSecOps intelligence platform

* A real-time graph analytics engine

It must communicate:
This system thinks, explores, maps, analyzes, and decides autonomously.
Not a testing tool.
An AI-driven QA operating system.

                     * Click actions

                     * Highlighted elements when inspected

Overlay indicators:
When AI inspects an element:
→ Soft glowing border around element
→ Tooltip: “Analyzing password input…”
When defect detected:
→ Red pulse around element
→ Small floating severity badge
BOTTOM of browser window:
Mini Navigation Timeline:
Shows:
Home → Login → Dashboard → Settings → Logout
Clickable steps.
RIGHT PANEL:
Live DOM Insight:
                        * Current URL
